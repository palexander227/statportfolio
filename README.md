# STATIC HTML-CSS Portfolio 

## Description

A portfolio of work can showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights one's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search. This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. This portfolio is a very nice template for anyone looking to venture into this world. We use very minimalist HTML and CSS but offer strong functionality.
